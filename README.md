# Smart Contract Development

An Ethereum Smart Contract starter project development environment will be defined here, in the form of an ERC20 token called ClevelandCoin.

ClevelandCoin (`CLE`) is a new Ethereum ERC20 formed in Cleveland, OH, at the [Crypto Cleveland Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Crypto-Cleveland/).
It has been developed as a resource to learn how to create Ethereum contracts, and the goal is to continue researching and adding features until the community is comfortable releasing the token on the main Ethereum blockchain, by doing an ICO.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* NodeJS / NPM:
  * https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
* Yarn
  * https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
* ethereumjs-testrpc
  * https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc
* Truffle:
  * http://truffleframework.com/
* MetaMask
  * https://metamask.io/

### Installing

After cloning this repository and installing the above dependencies, perform

```
$ yarn install
```

to get the `zeppelin-solidity` boilerplate project files installed. In a new terminal window, start

```
$ testrpc
```

which starts a new local ethereum blockchain running on `localhost:8545`. You'll see some output like the following:

```
EthereumJS TestRPC v4.1.3 (ganache-core: 1.1.3)

HD Wallet
==================
Mnemonic:      predict abandon immune breeze movie divide seminar frost tragic grunt lonely monitor
Base HD Path:  m/44'/60'/0'/0/{account_index}

Listening on localhost:8545
```

Take note of the `Mnemonic` seed, you'll need it when you setup MetaMask.

Next, perform

```
$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate
```

which will deploy the contract onto your local ethereum blockchain.

You should see some output like the following:

```

```

Take note of the line `ClevelandCoin: 0xe727f76b086e0881809a8d834a6d7947aafbf344`
This is the address that the `ClevelandCoin` contract was deployed to.

Open Chrome, navigate to `https://wallet.ethereum.org`. Open the MetaMask extension and "Restore from Seed Phrase", using the Mnemonic seed from above.
Also, make sure that MetaMask is pointing at `localhost:8545`, which can be configured from the dropdown in the top-left corner of MetaMask's window.

In the ethereum wallet browser in Chrome, navigate to the "Contracts" tab, scroll to the bottom, and click "Watch Token".
Copy the contract address that `truffle migrate` gave you (`0xe727f76b086e0881809a8d834a6d7947aafbf344` in this example), and click "OK".

If all went well, you should see the `ClevelandCoin` token with a balance of 216,000,000 CLE!

Use MetaMask to create new accounts (which will match the accounts that `testrpc` displayed to you upon startup - thank the Mnemonic seed phrase for that), switch between them, and send tokens back and forth using the Ethereum Web Wallet.

## Running the tests
